## QF

### Integrated_20220727191534_1.root

Low voltages, low thresholds for all BDs.

### Integrated_20220727204627_1.root

Low voltages, high thresholds for all BDs.

### Integrated_20220727214104_1.root

Voltages were increased by 100 V, high thresholds for all BDs.

BD 7 had wrong HV, it should be excluded from analysis.

### Integrated_20220727222749_1.root

Same voltages as the previous run, high thresholds for all BDs. HV on BD 7 was fixed in this run

### Integrated_20220727233254_1.root

Voltages were increased by another 100 V.

### Integrated_20220728005806_1.root

Voltages were increased by another 50 V.

### Integrated_20220728020808_1.root

BD 0 + 50 V, BD 1 + 25 V, BD 2 + 25 V,
BD 5 + 25 V, BD 9 + 30 V
